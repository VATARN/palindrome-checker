# Palindrome Checker

## Overview

The Palindrome Checker is a simple, interactive web application designed to determine if a given string of text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. This tool is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and offers a user-friendly interface for quick palindrome verification.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features a straightforward layout with a clear title and input area, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.
- **Real-Time Input and Feedback:** Users can type or paste text into the input field and receive immediate feedback upon submission.
- **Robust Palindrome Checking Logic:** The JavaScript function `checkIfPalindrome` efficiently checks for palindromes, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity.
- **Alert for Empty Input:** An alert notifies the user if the submit button is clicked without entering any text.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application:** Load the HTML file in a web browser.
2. **Enter Text:** Type or paste the text you want to check into the input field.
3. **Submit:** Click the "Submit" button to check if the entered text is a palindrome.
4. **View Result:** The result will be displayed below the button, indicating whether the text is a palindrome.
